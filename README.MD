 item (pull request, ticket, source code, document, etc).

A simple browser extension that reads the page content from Jira/Bitbucket/Confluence and requests OpenAI GPT to explain/summarize the content.

The extension runs on the browser and first checks whether a Jira/Bitbucket/Confluence page is open.

This extension does not handle personal or sensitive user data. It only leverages the contents of the Jira/Bitbucket/Confluence page to send to OpenAI asking for the explanation/summarization. Nothing else is sent to any other server.
