## GPT Extension for Jira/Bitbucket

# Gets a GPT answer about a Jira/Bitbucket item (pull request, ticket, source code, etc).

A simple browser extension that reads the page content from Jira/Bitbucket and requests OpenAI GPT to explain/summarize the content.

The extension runs on the browser and first checks whether a Jira/Bitbucket page is open.

This extension does not handle personal or sensitive user data. It only leverages the contents of the Jira/Bitbucket page to send to OpenAI asking for the explanation/summarization. Nothing else is sent to any other server.
